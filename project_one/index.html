        <p>The <strong>Beagle</strong> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger
          foxhound.
          The
          <strong>beagle</strong> was
          developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
          tracking
          instincts, the <strong>beagle</strong> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited
          agricultural
          imports and
          foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <strong>beagle</strong> is a popular pet due to its size, good
          temper, and a lack
          of inherited health problems.
        </p>
        <p>The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot
          Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
          Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more
          recently in film, television, and comic books.</p>
